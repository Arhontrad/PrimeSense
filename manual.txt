Building the Wrapper
====================
First of all, make sure you have all the requires packages installed. See requires.txt
or run ``pip install -r requires.txt`` to install them.

Once you have the dependencies, go to the ``bin/`` directory of this repo and edit ``sources.ini``.
It should point to the location of the include directory of both OpenNI and NiTE.

Then run ``python build_all.py``, which would build openNI and NiTE and create redist artifacts.
The artifacts could be found under the ``dist/`` directory on the repo's root.
``build_all.py`` can also accept some switches. For example, ``--upload`` will upload the package
to PyPI; to upload new versions of the files without changing their version (a new release), 
first remove the files from PyPI (using the web interface) and run ``build_all.py --upload --dont-register``.
